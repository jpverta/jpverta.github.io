**J-P Verta - Primmer lab post-doc - University of Helsinki - Evolution, genetics and conservation**

I investigate the roles of gene regulatory mechanisms in the divergence of species, populations and sexes. Presently I study Atlantic salmon with the goal to link variation in life-history traits to gene regulatory evolution. I use systems genetics to bring further insight into the molecular mechanisms that generate and sustain variation in life-history traits, and thus explain the evolution of biological diversity at the molecular level.

In addition to basic research, I work towards making genetics research accessible among the public and raise awereness of species in risk.

If you want to hear more about my research listen to [this](https://soundcloud.com/evolution-conservation-genomics-evolcongen/coffee-talk-with-jukka-pekka-verta) podcast with me blabbering about science, fishing and more.
