I investigate the roles of gene regulatory mechanisms in the divergence of species, populations and sexes. I study natural populations with the overarching goal to link regulatory evolution with adaptation and incipient speciation. Many of the approaches that I use are based on systems genetics - the study of how interacting levels of gene regulation (such as epigenetic marks and gene transcription) combine genetic information and translate it to produce variation in life.

In addition to basic research, I work towards making genetics research accessible among the public and raise awereness of species in risk.
