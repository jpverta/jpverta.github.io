**J-P Verta - Associate Professor - Nord University**

## Welcome

The overarching goal of my research is to understand the mechanisms that create and maintain phenotypic diversity from the molecular to the species level. To reach this goal, I study the genetic and molecular basis of complex adaptive phenotypes such as life histories, as such traits underlie much of biological diversity and provide keys to understand evolution. 

**I am looking for PhD students for 2025 - please don't hesitate to contact me**

## Topics

**Evolution** is the fundamental source of diversity of life. Over 150 years after Darwin, we are still continuing to discover new and amazing ways evolution contributes to biological diversity, both within a species and among them. Understanding the mechanisms that are responsible of evolution has been, and still is, a central goal in biology.

All biology centres on survival until reproduction, which makes variation in **life-history traits** one of the central sources of diversity. Individuals irrespective of species often make trade-offs between the life-history traits such as growth, survival and reproduction. Very little is know about the molecular basis of variation in different life-history strategies, yet a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of life-history variation is key to explain the evolutionary process (see [Verta et al 2020](papers.md) on this topic).

**Systems genetics**, the study of how interacting levels of gene regulation (such as epigenetic marks and gene transcription) combine genetic information and translate it to produce biological diversity, is a powerful tool to dissect the functional mechanisms behind trait variation. I use systems genetics to bring insight into the molecular mechanisms that generate and sustain variation in adaptive physiological and life-history traits, and thus explain the evolution of biological diversity at the molecular level (see [Verta, Landry & MacKay 2016, Verta & Jones 2019, Verta et al 2020, Verta et al 2021, Verta & Jacobs 2021](papers.md) on this topic).
