I investigate the roles of gene regulatory mechanisms in the divergence of species, populations and sexes. Presently I study Atlantic salmon with the overarching goal to link variation in life-history traits to gene regulatory evolution. Many of the approaches that I use are based on systems genetics - the study of how interacting levels of gene regulation (such as epigenetic marks and gene transcription) combine genetic information and translate it to produce biological diversity.

In addition to basic research, I work towards making genetics research accessible among the public and raise awereness of species in risk.
