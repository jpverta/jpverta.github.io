**J-P Verta - Primmer lab post-doc - University of Helsinki - Evolution, genetics and conservation**

I investigate the genetic mechanisms behind the divergence of species, populations and sexes. Presently I study adaptive life-history traits in Atlantic salmon. I use systems genetics to bring insight into the molecular mechanisms that generate and sustain variation in life-history traits, and thus explain the evolution of biological diversity at the molecular level. My long-term goal is that by dissecting evolutionary processes into their molecular and functional underpinnings we can gain insight into the mechanisms of adaptation that will help us to make informed decisions on conservation and natural resource use.

In addition to basic research, I work towards making genetics research accessible among the public and raise awereness of species in risk.

If you want to hear more about my research listen to [this](https://soundcloud.com/evolution-conservation-genomics-evolcongen/coffee-talk-with-jukka-pekka-verta) podcast with me blabbering about science, fishing and more.
