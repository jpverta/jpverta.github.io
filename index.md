**J-P Verta - Primmer lab post-doc - University of Helsinki - Evolution, genetics and conservation**

My research aims to understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms behind the divergence of species, populations and sexes. Presently I study adaptive life-history traits in Atlantic salmon. I use systems genetics to bring insight into the molecular mechanisms that generate and sustain variation in life-history traits, and thus explain the evolution of biological diversity at the molecular level. My long-term goal is that by dissecting the functional genetic basis of evolutionary processes we can gain insight into the mechanisms of adaptation that will help us to conserve biodiversity and inform decisions on use of natural resources.
