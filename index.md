**J-P Verta - Primmer lab post-doc - University of Helsinki - Evolution, genetics and conservation**

I study the evolutionary and ecological processes underlying adaptation and species diversification. My research aims to understand the genetic, epigenetic and molecular mechanisms behind the divergence of species, populations and sexes. Presently, I use systems genetics in Atlantic salmon to bring insight into the molecular mechanisms that generate and sustain variation in life-history traits, and thus explain the evolution of biological diversity at the molecular level. Previously I have worked on conifer trees, yeasts and stickleback fish to elucidate the genetic architecture and molecular mechanisms of adaptive evolution. My long-term goal is that by dissecting the functional genetic basis of evolutionary processes we can gain insight into the mechanisms of adaptation that will help us to conserve biodiversity and inform decisions on use of natural resources.
