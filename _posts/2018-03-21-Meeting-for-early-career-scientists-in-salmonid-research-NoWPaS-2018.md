In March 2018 I had the pleasure to attend to a conference for early-career scientists working on anadromous salmonids. With only the four keynote speakers being senior scientists (Andrew Hendry from McGill Uni, Pauliina Louhi from Parks & Wildlife Finland, Katja Anttila from Uni Turku and Craig Primmer from Uni Helsinki), we truly were a young and jolly crew of 32 fish lovers. I felt amongst fellow freaks from the moment we arrived at the Oulanka research station.

Being around such energetic and enthusiastic scientists really gave a big motivation push for getting back to the lab as soon as possible and roll up my sleeves. I was impressed by the quality of the presentations, ranging from genomics to behavior and management. I feel confident to say this was the most high-quality workshop I've ever taken part, relative to the experience of the participants. It also made it clear that the expectation in the field is to be nothing less than excellent!

I have felt the need to partake in practical efforts to help our endangered salmon and trout populations back here in Finland. Meeting the key young scientists working on salmon conservation was a first and crucial step seeing that I've been away for so long and new to salmonid research. I'm hoping that I can be of help to them and the larger conservation community.

I haven't mentioned anything about off-topic activities, but I'm sure you can imagine that the atmosphere among a bunch of young scientists stuck in the middle of nowhere cannot be anything but hilarious. The absolute activity-hit was the Finnish spa a.k.a. hole in the ice :)

Until next year, NoWPaS!
