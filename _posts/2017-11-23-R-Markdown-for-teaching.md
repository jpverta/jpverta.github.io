A colleague of mine recently introduced me to a useful tool for creating, managing and sharing R code. We are both part of a team teaching a practical course on the statistical programming language R, and my colleague proposed that we would organise the workshops as R Markdown Notebooks. What an excellent idea!

If you are used to working with R Studio on your local computer implementing your code as R Markdown is really simple. I usually work on our campus server, and organise my code as scripts for simplicity. I found that R Markdown is nevertheless an excellent tool for teaching, and makes workshops in general easier for all parties. Here's how it [works](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

The basic idea is that instead of a script that you execute, you organise your work as a interactive "notebook" (a bit like [jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)Â for Python code). For teaching, I found this very helpful as I can organise my tutorials around code examples that the student execute on their computers while still properly explaining the ideas. I found it helpful to have the more theory-heavy text and the hands-on exercise integrated into one smooth workflow. In addition, organising your tutorial as a Markdown file allows the students to keep all that information in a easily accessible format or even print it out as a neat pdf. Give it a try!
