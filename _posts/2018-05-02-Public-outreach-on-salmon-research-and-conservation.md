Many thanks to Helsinki Spey Clave for the opportunity to talk about the
importance of big salmon conservation! The Helsinki-based fly-fishing
shop was very kind to slot me some time during their "Season Starter"
event to talk about recent findings in the genetics of Atlantic salmon
age at maturity and what this means for anglers. Awesome event with many
intelligent questions and attentive anglers in the audience.
