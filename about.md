#### Evolutionary systems genetics and variation in life-history traits #### 

Evolution is the fundamental source of diversity of life. Over 150 years after Darwin, we are still continuing to discover new and amazing ways evolution contributes to biological diversity, both within a species and among them. Understanding the mechanisms that are responsible of evolution has been, and still is, a central goal in biology.

Early in modern genetics when comparisons between species became possible, King & Wilson (1975 Science 188:107-116) made a startling observation; gene sequences from species as different as humans and chimpanzees were so alike that differences in genes themselves could not account for differences between species. The hypothesis was that the stuff of evolution was not in genes, but in the way genes were regulated. Gene regulatory evolution and how it affects differences between species and ecotypes has since become one of the main questions in biology.

All biology centres on survival until reproduction, which makes variation in life-history traits one of the central sources of diversity. Individuals irrespective of species often make trade-offs between the life-history traits such as growth, survival and reproduction. Very little is know about the molecular basis of variation in different life-history strategies, yet a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of life-history variation has broad impacts throughout biology.

Systems genetics, the study of how interacting levels of gene regulation (such as epigenetic marks and gene transcription) combine genetic information and translate it to produce biological diversity, is a powerful tool to dissect the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms behind trait variation. My research aims to utilise the approaches of systems genetics to bring further insight into the molecular mechanisms that generate and sustain variation in life-history traits, and thus explain the evolution of biological diversity on the molecular level.
