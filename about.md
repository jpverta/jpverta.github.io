#### What is evolutionary systems genetics? #### 

Evolution is the fundamental source of diversity of life. Over 150 years after Darwin, we are still continuing to discover new and amazing ways evolution contributes to biological diversity, both within a species and among them.  Understanding the mechanisms that are responsible of evolution has been, and still is, a central goal in biology.

Early in modern genetics when comparisons between species became possible King & Wilson (1975 Science 188:107-116) made a startling observation; gene sequences from species as different as humans and chimpanzees were so alike that differences in genes themselves could not account for differences between species. The hypothesis was that the stuff of evolution was not in genes, but in the way genes were regulated. Gene regulatory evolution and how it affects differences between species and ecotypes has since become one of the main questions in biology.

I investigate the roles of gene regulatory mechanisms in the divergence of species, populations and sexes. I study natural populations with the overarching goal to link regulatory evolution with variation in life-history traits, adaptation and incipient speciation. Many of the approaches that I use are based on systems genetics - the study of how interacting levels of gene regulation (such as epigenetic marks and gene transcription) combine genetic information and translate it to produce variation in life.

In addition to basic research, I work towards making genetics research accessible among the public and raise awereness of species in risk.
