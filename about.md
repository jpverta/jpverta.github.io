#### What is evolutionary systems genetics? #### 

Evolution is the fundamental source of diversity of life. Over 150 years after Darwin, we are still continuing to discover new and amazing ways evolution contributes to biological diversity, both within a species and among them.  Understanding the mechanisms that are responsible of evolution has been, and still is, a central goal in biology.

Early in modern genetics when comparisons between species became possible King & Wilson (1975 Science 188:107-116) made a startling observation; gene sequences from species as different as humans and chimpanzees were so alike that differences in genes themselves could not account for differences between species. The hypothesis was that the stuff of evolution was not in genes, but in the way genes were regulated. Gene regulatory evolution and how it affects differences between species and ecotypes has since become one of the main questions in biology.
