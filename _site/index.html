<p>I investigate the roles of gene regulatory mechanisms in the divergence of species, populations and sexes. I study natural populations with the overarching goal to link regulatory evolution with adaptation and incipient speciation. Many of the approaches that I use are based on systems genetics - the study of how interacting levels of gene regulation (such as epigenetic marks and gene transcription) combine genetic information and translate it to produce variation in life.</p>

<p>In addition to basic research, I work towards making genetics research accessible among the public and raise awereness of species in risk.</p>
